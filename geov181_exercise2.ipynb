    "# Exercise 2: Analysis of global earthquake data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction to the subsurface\n",
    "\n",
    "In module 1 of this course you have looked at data from the Earth's surface. These data are two-dimensional, which means that you need two coordinates to find any of these data (x and y, or latitude and longitude). In exercise 1a and 1b in this module (module 2) we introduced a new \"coordinate\", which is time, and we used timeseries data to study Earth's climate history. In this exercise we will work with data that has three dimensions, an x and y coordinate to locate our place on the surface of the Earth, and depth, which defines how deep below the surface our datapoints are located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying the earth below our feet is an important part of the earth sciences. The subsurface, surface and atmosphere of our planet influence each other and are linked together in one system. Studying the subsurface is important for many applications, such as CO2 storage, geothermal energy, mineral resources, and for geohazards, such as earthquakes that we will discuss today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main methods that researchers use to study the subsurface are boreholes and geophysical data, such as seismic data or georadar, which can generate images of the subsurface. See for example the seismic image of a part of the North Sea below. Boreholes provide direct access to a small part of the subsurface, and samples from boreholes provide us with a lot of information, including the paleoclimate data that you studied in exercise 1b.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Earthquakes\n",
    "\n",
    "One indirect but very useful source of information on the subsurface is earthquakes. Earthquakes are [\"the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake). You will probably have heard about or seen earthquakes in the news, such as the devastating [earthquake in Turkey and Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquakes) in 2023. Earthquakes are a major hazard, and studying earthquakes will hopefully help to be prepared and to miminize the damage caused by these quakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most earthquakes are caused by the natural movement of different blocks of the earth's subsurface relative to each other. This movement is often not smooth, but occurs in small jumps that create earthquakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earthquakes have a lot to teach us about how our planet works. The arrival times of seismic waves from an earthquake at different seismic stations on the surface provides us with the means to triangulate and locate these earthquakes. The reconstruction of the seismic wave paths and velocities has provided us with information on the structure of the earth, such as the fact that the [earth's subsurface contains different layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_Earth), like the crust, the mantle and a core. You can learn more on this later in the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The department of Earth Science at our university is very active in geophysics and the study of earthquakes (also known as seismology), and hosts the Norwegian National Seismic Network. You can read more about their activities here: https://www.uib.no/en/rg/geophysics/54014/earthquake-seismology, or look at recent earthquakes in Norway and surrounding areas here: https://nnsn.geo.uib.no/nnsn/#/\n",

    "In this exercise we will visualize and analyse a large database of all global earthquakes that have magnitude 5 or higher. The data are from [the international seismological centre](https://www.isc.ac.uk/). To analyse these data we will use new new mapping tools in Python, and new statistical analysis to see if two datasets are statistically different or not. Similarly to exercise 1b, we will try to use the data and our analyses to answer a set of research questions.\n",

    "# Section 3: Plate tectonics and earthquakes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: plate tectonics\n",
    "\n",
    "[Plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics) is arguably the latest major scientific advance in the natural sciences. It took its final form in the 1950s and 1960s, and is therefore younger than other major new theories in the 20th century, such as general and special relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. It revolutionized geology and all of a sudden made it possible to make sense of the way the earth looks, why there are deep ocean trenches, sedimentary basins, mountain belts and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plate tectonics geologist had come up with several complicated theories to explain what they observed. A popular idea was the [expanding earth theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_Earth), which proposed that earth was continuously expanding to explain the creation of new ocean crust at spreading ridges. Other geologist working in mountain belts had proposed a [shrinking earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_global_cooling) instead, to explain why the rocks there had been shoved on top of each other. These two theories obviously do not work well together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably the paper that finally put together all the pieces of the puzzle of plate tectonics to explain sea floor spreading, the subduction and the collision of plates and the formation of mountain belts is the paper [Rises, trenches, great faults, and crustal blocks](https://doi.org/10.1029/JB073i006p01959) by Jason Morgan in 1968, who proposed that the outer shell of the earth consists of several rigid plates that move away from each other at ocean ridges, towards each other at collision or subduction zones, and along each other at transform zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of plate tectonics started much earlier with the theory of continental drift proposed by several scientist in the late 19th and early 20th century, perhaps the most well known is Alfred Wegener. Maps and data of ocean ridges in the 1960 proved that new crust is generated there by magma and that each side of the ridge moves apart slowly, such as the map by Heezen and Tharp below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of plate tectonics is fascinating, if you want to read more about this I can warmly recommend the book \"Plate Tectonics: An Insider's History Of The Modern Theory Of The Earth\" by Naomi Oreskes, with a nice summary [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/501027a)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Collision zone: This is the collision zone (convergent boundary) between two continental plates. Plates move towards each other.\n",
    "* Extension zone: A zone where a plate is extended (stretched) but where the extension has not yet gone far enough to create new oceanic crust\n",
    "* Spreading centre: A location where a plate that consists of oceanic crust moves apart and the gap is filled by magma that forms new oceanic crust\n",
    "* Subduction zone: A zone where one tectonic plate subducts (sinks) below another\n",
    "* Transform: A zone where two plates move past one another. A famous example is the [San Andreas fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault)\n",
    "* Inferred: An unknown plate boundary\n",

We could do this more correctly and project our data to an [equal area projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-area_projection), where the coordinates have units of meters instead of degrees. Unfortunately, this turns out to be too slow in Google Colab, so we use the faster method instead.\n",

    "So far we have mostly looked at the spatial distirbution of earthquakes and how they cluster around plate boundaries. In this section we will look at how the earthquakes are distributed with depth, and how this correlates with the structure of the earth. As mentioned in the introduction, [the earth has an internal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_Earth), and is subdivided in several layers. On top we have the [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust), which is the outermost shell that consists of relatively light rocks. There is a sharp transition in seismic wave velocity at the base of the crust, which is called the [Mohorovic discontinuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87_discontinuity), or the Moho. The [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) is the rigid outmost shell of the earth that consists of the crust and the upper mantle. The lithosphere is mechanically strong compared to the underlying [astenosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere), which is why deformation of the lithosphere tends to concentrate along the boundaries of relatively rigid tectonic plates.\n",

    "We will use data on the thickness of the crust and lithosphere that were published by [Afonso et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz094). These researchers have used seismic data and several other geophysical methods to estimate how thick these layers are.\n",

    "2. Why is there such a difference between the boundaries? \n",
    "3. Why do earthquakes cluster around certain depths in the crust and lithosphere? \n",

    "Try to find answers to the questions above in the scientific literature. A good start as usual is looking at Wikipedia, or asking Copilot. Next try to look at figures or explanations in the scientific literature that they cite, or try to find research papers yourself using google scholar: https://scholar.google.com/"
