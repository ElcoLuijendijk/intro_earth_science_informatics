    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of earth science is trying to look back into time to figure out what happened to our planet through geological history. For the more recent history earth science relies on historical measurements. However for going deeper into history earth science relies on extracting information from old sediments and rocks that are exposed at the surface, or buried below the surface and accessed through boreholes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this first part of this module is to get familiar with the analysis of timeseries data, which is data that describes how something has varied over time. We will work with data that informs us how the climate on our small planet has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into deep geological history, we will first visualize and analyze more recent global temperature data that covers the period from the year 1850 to present. We will work with this data to see if we can identify trends and rhythms (periodic changes) in this dataset. Once we master this we will move on to exercise 1b where we will perform the same analysis, but then on climate data that spans the last 65 million years of the history of our planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise was inspired by a classical paper by James Zachos and co-authors called \"[Trends, Rhythms, and Aberrations in Global Climate 65 Ma to Present](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1059412)\". These authors were one of the first to look at the long-term climate history of our planet, and tried to identify trends, rhythms and abberations in the global climate data. We will follow their lead, but use newer and more extensive data for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will learn more about earth science, in particular climate history, and you will obtain new skills in data analysis and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does this exercise work?\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook. A Jupyter notebook contains a mix of text blocks and [Python](https://www.python.org/) code blocks that you can run yourself. The text blocks are used to explain the data analysis workflow of this exercise. The data analysis itself is performed in blocks of Python code. The Python code blocks contain a mix of actual code and comments, which start with `#` and which describe what each line of code below does.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programming language that is relatively easy to learn. A progamming language is a instruction language for a computer to make it do things that we find useful, such as analyzing climate data for us. Thanks to its accessibility Python has become the most popular programming language in science.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run this notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Google Colab gives us the opportunity to run this notebook online and in a web browser, which is the easiest way to complete this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you prefer not to use Google then you can also run this notebook on your own computer. This requires installing Python and Jupyter on your own machine. The easiest to get things running is to install the Python distribution Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/ (notice the odd preference for snake names in the Python world). This may require a bit more fiddling, but your instructors for this exercise are happy to help out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with this Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, make a copy of this notebook by selecting `File` and one of the `Save a copy...` options. This is to make sure you work on your own copy of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run each block of code by selecting the block and pressing the run symbol on the left of the block, or by pressing shift-enter. Or you can select `runtime` and then `Run all` to run all code blocks, `Run after` to run the selected code block and all blocks that come afterwards, or `Run before` to run all code blocks before the code block that you have selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignments and handing in this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise contains a number of assignments, where you either have to complete a code block, or write some text in a text block below the assignment. These assignments are marked clearly and numbered. You can hand in the assignments by modifying this notebook, downloading a copy as a .ipynb file, i.e., a jupyter notebook file, and handing in the completed notebook file on mitt.uib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some assignments will ask you to write an answer in a text block. Please only add the answer in the clearly marked text block below these assignments, and do not create a new text block for the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting help\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably run into programming errors when tryin to answer the coding assignments in this notebook. The error messages will appear below the code block where the error occured. Try to first scroll through the error message to find the line of your code that generated the error. The error message also gives a description of the type of error, which however may often be a bit difficult to understand. There are a few ways to try to fix such programming errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First check if the other students at your table have had a similar error, and ask if and how they have solved it.\n",
    "- Look up the documentation of the command that you are using online for an explanation of what it does. For example the linear regression function that you will be using can be found here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html Similar descriptions exist for all the python code that you will be using.\n",
    "- Copy paste the error message and the code line into copilot and ask it to explain why this error may occur and how it could be fixed.\n",
    "- Ask one of the lecturers. We are around and provide help for free of course. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning more\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that throughout this notebook we also provide links to papers or descriptions of data analysis methods or Python modules that you can read if you want to dive more into the earth science, data analysis and programming parts of this exercise."

The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that the effect that is being studied does not exist, and that the relation between two variables is due to chance only, i.e. is purely random. In this case, the null hypothesis tests whether or not the linear regression explains the relation between temperature and time. A probability of 1 shows that the null hypothesis is true, i.e. there is no linear correlation between time and temperature. In contrast, if the probability is 0.0 there is no probability that the null hypothesis is true, and the relation between the two cannot be random. In general a value of `p` that is less than 0.05 is accepted, because there is then a probability of less than 5% that the relation is due to chance.\n",

Does it explain all of the data or are there still some unexplained trends or noise in the data? For this we need to look at a different metric, the [coefficient of determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination). A simple definition of the coefficient of determination is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2 = 1 - \\dfrac{\\text{unexplained variance}}{\\text{variance of the dataset}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from this definition the value of $R^2$ goes to 1.0 if all of the variance of the data can be explained by the model. And if the unexplained variance is equal to the variance of the dataset, the model is actually useless and $R^2$ equals 0.0. Getting a model prediction close to an $R^2$ of 1.0 is the goal of most models, but is rarely feasible in the earth sciences because there are often many different processes that affect geoscientific data and constructing a model that represents all processes well is often difficult.\n",

    "## Optional advanced section 7: Which models are good and which is best?\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have several different models to quantify the long-term trend in the global temperature data. Each model has a different $R^2$ value. At first sight we might be tempted to simply select the model with the highest $R^2$ value as the best model. However this is not entirely a fair way of selecting the best model. Imagine if we had used the piecewise linear model, but had increased the amount of segments to 1000. After a lot of number crunching the algorithm would come up with a near perfect model, where almost every temperature datapoint has its own line segment that overlies each datapoint. This model will obviously have a very high $R^2$ that would be close to 1.0, because it fits the data perfectly. It however also requires a 1000 input parameter values. And its value in predicting future warming may be very limited, because these 1000 parameters are exactly tuned to the data but may not capture the processes that cause the warming very well. Such a model is a case of a model that is *overfitted* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Form a science philosophy viewpoint, scientific models and theories should follow Occam's razor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor), which is usually summarized as \"The simplest explanation is usually the best one\". Or in our case, the model with the least unnecessary assumptions is the best one. Therefore, we should in principle select the simplest model that fits the data well, i.e. a good model with a low number of parameters. However this raises a question which model should be rated best, the simple linear regression with just two parameters, but a poor fit to the data, or a more complex model with more parameters, but a better fit?\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting we can resort to alternative metrics that take into account the complexity of a model. We will use two metrics here, the [Akaike information criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) or AIC and the [Bayesian information criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion) or BIC. Both AIC and BIC take into account the model error or residual, i.e., how far off the model is from the data, and the number of parameters that a model requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Akaike information criterion is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AIC = N \\ln \\left( \\dfrac{RSS}{N} \\right)+ 2 K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of observations or datapoints, $K$ is the number of parameters and $RSS$ is the sum of the squared residuals, which is calculated by comparing each datapoint to the model prediction, squaring this and then summing all squared residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS = \\sum{(y_p - y)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $y_p$ is the value predicted by the model and $y$ is the actual data. The Bayesian information criterion is calculated in a similar way, but with a slightly different weighing of the importance of the number of parameters vs the model error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$BIC = N \\ln \\left( \\dfrac{RSS}{N} \\right)+ \\sqrt{N} K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIC metric tends to assign a higher importance to the number of parameters (K) in most cases, because $\\sqrt{N}$ is usually higher than 2. For both metrics the model that has the lowest AIC or BIC score is the best, because both a high model error (RSS) or a high number of parameters (K) increase the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use either of these two metrics in the rest of this exercise. There is an ongoing debate in the statistics community on which one is better, but for now it seems a matter of personal preference. If you want to read more about this you can check [this paper by Ding et al. (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8498082) (which is addmittedly not the easiest paper to read)."

    "Congrats, you finished the first exercise! We hope you enjoyed it. In this exercise you learned basic data visualisation and data analysis skills for timeseries data. In the process you have also learned something about historic climate change and $CO_2$. Now you are ready to move on to working with climate data that goes much further back in time and that covers the last 65 million years of our planet's history. This will be the topic of next week's exercise."
