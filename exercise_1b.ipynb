    "# Exercise 1b: Analysis of global temperatures and $CO_2$ in the last 66 million years\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After our look into the historic changes in temperature we are now ready to dive back further in time and look at how climate has changed on our small planet in the last 66 million years. This part of our planet's history is called the [Cenozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic). For this exercise we will use the same basic tools as we have used in the previous exercise: looking for long-term trends by fitting trend models, looking for periodic changes using Fourier analysis, and quantifying the relation between $CO_2$ in the atmosphere and temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paleoclimate and proxies\n",
    "The difference is that instead of looking at actual measurements, we will be using indirect information on climate and $CO_2$ in the geological past. For most of the time there were obviously no humans present to measure temperature or $CO_2$. The dinosaurs were extinct, and the other mammals were lazy and also did not measure temperature. So how can we study climate history? For this scientist rely on studying drill cores from sediments at the bottom of the ocean. Sediments are being deposited continuously in the ocean, and therefore the deeper you drill the older the sediments get. A sediment core is therefore a bit like a time machine into the geological past.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sediments can not tell you directly what the temperature was at the time they were being deposited. However, scientist have developed methods to measure oxygen isotopes in shells from organisms that lived on the seafloor. Isotopes are atoms with a higher number of neutrons than the regular version of the oxygen atom. The abundance of these isotopes correlates with the temperature of the seafloor. Similarly, other isotopes in these organisms correlate with the pH of the seawater, which in turn correlates with $CO_2$ in the atmosphere. So with data from these drill cores we can reconstruct how temperature and $CO_2$ have changed in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that researchers from our university are very active in studying the climate history of our planet. See for instance the [department of Quaternary geology and Paleoclimate](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/quaternary), the [Bjerknes Centre](https://bjerknes.uib.no/en/global-climate-research-theme) and the isotope lab [Farlab](https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB).

    "For this exercise you will use the same tools that you have used in exercise 1a to quantify trends and periodic changes in climate. We will start working on analysis of the entire Cenozoic period, or at least the part of the Cenozoic where we have good data, which starts at 56 million years ago. In addition, we will work on the Quaternary period, because it is the period that we live in and lots of interesting things happened to our planet's climate during this period.\n",

    "## Assignments and handing in this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise contains several assignments, where you either have to complete a code block, or write some text in a text block. These assignments are marked clearly and numbered. Please hand in the assignments by modifying this notebook and handing in the completed notebook file on mitt.uib. You can download the notebook by selecting File > Download > Download .ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also hand in a pdf version of this notebook, which you can generate by selecting File > Print > Save as PDF. The PDF file is a backup, in case something goes wrong with the notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this exercise also contains two bonus assignments. These are not compulsory. They were designed to give you some extra scientific background into the causes of the trends and rhythms that you will find in the paleoclimate data. You can try to work on these bonus assignments if you have time left after completing the compulsory assignments."

    "\n",
    "We will use paleotemperature data published in [2020 by Westerhold et al](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba6853). Their estimates of temperature are based on oxygen isotopes from the shells of [foraminifera](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba6853), which are organisms that live on the sea floor. The relation between their oxygen isotope composition and deep-sea temperature follows a somewhat complicated and still uncertain relation that depends on the sea ice cover in the past and other factors. [Hansen et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2012.0294) provided equations to calculate deep-sea temperatures from the isotope data, and to then calculate sea surface temperatures from deep-ocean temperatures. The resulting surface temperatures have been published online in a [data and code repository](https://github.com/SPATIAL-Lab/CenoCO2/) that accompanies a [recent paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi5177). In this section we will download this data and visualize the temperature history of our planet over the last 66 million years."

    "As you can see in the output below the code blocks above, the $CO_2$-based temperature model has a decent $R^2$ value. However, visually the fit of the temperature model to the data does not look great, and the mean absolute error is relatively high. In addition, the model performs worse than other models in section 2.1, because it shows higher values of AIC and BIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the poor performance of the model can be seen in the cross-plot figure of temperature and $CO_2$ in section 2.2. There are sections where temperature and $CO_2$ are strongly correlated. However, there are also parts of the figure where the data seem to follow a horizontal line, where $CO_2$ changes, but temperature does not react. These regions where climate remains stable in spite of changes in $CO_2$ cluster around temperatures of 4 degrees and 13 degrees.\n",

    "From this we can conclude that the relation between $CO_2$ and temperature may be a bit more complicated than a simple linear regression, and that the relation between $CO_2$ and temperature has not remained equal accross geological history.

    "# Section 3: Periodic variations in paleotemperature and Milankovitch cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will see if we can find periodic variations in the paleotemperature record. If you look at the paleotemperature figures that we made earlier in the notebook you see a lot of tightly spaced wiggles, which could be rhythmic changes in temperature. For the historic temperatures we showed that annual changes and perhaps the ~5 year El Nino southern oscillation had an effect on temperatures. Here we will be looking at much longer timescales, where there may be an effect of Milankovitch cycles on climate. [Milankovitch cycles](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/) are periodic changes in the orbit of the earth and the tilt and precession of the axis of the earth. These changes affect how much solar radiation reaches the earth, which in turn affect temperature. [This website by NASA ](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/) includes an explanation and nice videos of Milankovitch cycles, and Figure 1 in [this paper by Zachos et al.

    "1. What can explain the trend or absence of trends in paleotemperature in the Quaternary?\n",
    "2. What can explain the relation between $CO_2$ and paleotemperature in the Quaternary?\n",
    "3. What causes the observed periodic changes in the Quaternary? Why do certain Milankovitch cycles influence climate more than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all quite difficult questions to answer, but we do not have to answer these questions fully here, any progress we can make towards finding an answer is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully the scientific literature does contain some answers to these questions. So let's try to use and learn from the work that other researchers have done on these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be surprised (or not), that the most practical way to start to look for answers to these research questions is to fist check Wikipedia (for example see \"Climate\" [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary)) or Copilot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers that Wikipedia or Copilot they provide are based on scientific research. The main way for researchers to share their findings is by describing these findings in [scientific papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing#Scholarly_paper). Wikipedia or Copilot will provide you with links or citations of these papers. You can also search for these papers yourself, using a specialized scientific search website like [https://scholar.google.com/](https://scholar.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular question two very helpful scientific papers are [Lisiecki and Raymo (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2006.09.005) and [Herbert (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-032320-104209).\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid spending too much time on reading these papers I would suggest reading the abstract and conclusions, and having a look at the figures first, to see if they actually discuss something that you need. And only then try to go through the text if you need more information."

    "That's it, you have finished this exercise. We hope you enjoyed this one. In the process you have looked back into geological history, learned how temperature and CO2 history are reconstructed, looked at trends and rhythms in Cenozoic and Quaternary climate, and tried to explain these. In addition, you have improved your data anlaysis skills and added non-parametric correlation tests to your portfolio. And finally you have seen the Python code to do this, which you can recycle in the future for your own research or data analysis project.\n",

    "Next week we will start a new exercise in which we will look at earthquake data from the subsurface. Here we will learn more about earthquakes, the structure of the upper part of the earth's subsurface. And we will learn even more data analysis skills. See you next wednesday!"
