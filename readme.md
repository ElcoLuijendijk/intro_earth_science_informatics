# Exercises for part two of GEOV181

This site contains exercises for the course [GEOV181, Introduction to earth science and informatics](https://www4.uib.no/en/courses/GEOV181).

These exercises belong to the second module of GEOV181, which focuses on visualizing and analyzing geoscience data that covers earth's history and the subsurface. For exercise 1a we will look at historic (1860 to present) climate data, exercise 1b covers climate data for the last 67 million years, and in exercise 2 we will analyze earthquake data.

Please follow one of the following links to open the exercises in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):


* [Exercise 1a: Analysis of global temperature from 1850 to present](http://colab.research.google.com/github/ElcoLuijendijk/intro_earth_science_informatics/blob/main/exercise_1a.ipynb)
* [Exercise 1b: TBA]()
* [Exercise 2: TBA]()


# Aims of these exercises

* Get familiar with visualizing and the analysis of timeseries data
* Get familiar with visualizing and the analysis of subsurface data
* Learn something about the climate history of our planet
* Learn something about earthquakes and the subsurface structure of our planet


# Pre-requisites

* An internet connected desktop or laptop
* A google account to run these notebooks in google colab. Alternatively you can run the exercises on your own machine too by first downloading this repository using the `<> Code` and the `Clone` or `Download ZIP options` on the top right of this site, installing a Python and Jupyter notebook environment, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), and then using running one of the exercise notebooks in this repository.
